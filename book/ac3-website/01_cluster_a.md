# Cluster A - Fluxes in the Arctic Boundary Layer 

![Icon of Cluster A](../logos/icon_a.png)

## Topic

Cloud and aerosol impact on profiles of turbulent and radiative energy fluxes

## Key question

Which factors dominate the influence of environmental factors on energy fluxes and the resulting warming/cooling due to Arctic clouds at the surface: the local interactions of aerosol particles with clouds, local thermodynamic and synoptic influences on cloud evolution, sea ice cover, or remote feedback mechanisms of air mass transformations and larger scale dynamics?

## Tools

Measurements from aircraft and ship, sea ice station with tethered balloon, modelling of small scale atmospheric processes and radiative transfer
