# ac3-book - Gateway to the (AC)³ research project on Arctic amplification

[Latest build](https://ac3-tr.github.io/ac3-book/)

This repository holds a jupyter book (version 2) with 

- background information
- data descriptions
- example use cases

about and from the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre (TRR 172) on Arctic Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and Surface Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)³ (2015 - 2027).

This book is being build as a legacy of (AC)³ and should help researchers learn more about our research results and quickly find the data, on which we based our results.
Thus, it aims to be finished by the end of 2027.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Develop structure of the book
- [ ] Incorporate [ac3-notebooks](xref:ac3notebooks) and [ac3airborne](xref:ac3airborne)
- [ ] Develop a template to provide members to add example notebooks showcasing the use of some data
- [ ] Link each example notebook to the platform(s) and data source(s) it uses
- [ ] List all example notebooks on the page of the respective platform(s) that created the data for it
- [ ] Port information from the website to the book
- [ ] Port information from campaign wikis and websites to the book
