# Cluster E - Integration & Synthesis

(clustere)=
[![Icon of Cluster E](../logos/icon_e.png)](./01_cluster_e.md)

## Topic:

- Exploit comprehensive observational record & employ a hierarchy of models
- Perform process-oriented and cross-scale model evaluation and develop improved model parametrization schemes
- Investigate long-term trends, spatio-temporal patterns and feedback mechanisms from models and observation
                
## Key question:

- What explains the lapse rate feedback in the Arctic as a key factor in Arctic amplification?
- Which unique and representative climate information is derived from long-term observations at Ny-Ålesund for the orographically influenced MIZ of the North Atlantic?
- How important is the knowledge about specific microphysical processes (such as depositional growth, riming, and aggregation) to determine the role of mixed-phase clouds in Arctic amplification?
- Do atmospheric conditions and sea-ice decline lead to significant changes in regional moisture transport and snowfall patterns in the Arctic?

## Tools:

Supersites, ship-, airborne-, and satellite-based observations, model simulations (ICON, HIRHAM, LES, CMIP5/6, SCM)
