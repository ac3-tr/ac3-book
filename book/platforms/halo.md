# HALO

This section is taken from the [Orcestra campaign book](xref:orcestra#halo).

The German High Altitude and Long-Range Research Aircraft (HALO) is a modified Gulfstream G550 and operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is equipped with remote sensing instruments and a facility to launch dropsondes. It has long endurance (up to 9 flight hours), a long range (about 8000 km), and a high ceiling altitude (15.5 km). Its flight speed is typically 240 m/s at 14 km, and 220 m/s at 9 km. As the aircraft is build to be flying at high altitudes, most of the instrumentation observes the atmosphere (and in particular clouds) from the nadir perspective.

## Instrumentation

The instrumentation of the HALO aircraft is based on contributions from various universities and research institutions. Each instrument is developed and operated by an individual group, which leads to a modern instrumentation suite and well-trained operators. This section includes individual contact points for the specific instruments.

In particular, the instrumentation consists of broadband radiometers (BACARDI), basic instrumentation (BAHAMAS), a dropsonde launching system (Dropsondes), the active (radar) and passive microwave package (HAMP), irradiance spectrometers (SMART), a thermal imager (VELOX), an infrared radiometer (VELOX-KT19), a water vapor differential absorption lidar (WALES) and spectral and polarization resolving imagers (specMACS).
